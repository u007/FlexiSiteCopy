A general purpose flexible utility to copy database from 1 site to another.
Currently tested on MODx 2 and standalone database.
Allow modification on data before inserting remote data

Instructions/HowTo?:
+ FTP/copy FlexiSiteCopy directory to remote site.
Example: /public_html/FlexiSiteCopy
+ Duplicate modx.php, and modify parameter accordingly
Example: $remoteurl = "http://www.copyfromdomain.com/FlexiSiteCopy/remote.php";
+ You may comment off these line for copy all function, without skipping rows
//$remoting->addEvent("save", "onModx2Save");
//$remoting->addEvent("before_copydata", "onModx2CopyData");
+ But as for MODx Revo, you will need these line for the local copy to work.


For MODx Revo, 
after copying data from remote,
login to manager and clear cache.
Remember to copy the files from remote.
